    "Geofencing is a useful tool and concept in geographic data science and is used in many domain applications, including business, conservation, and security, as well as home automation. The concept of geofencing is very simple, yet it is a powerful technique that enriches location applications. Simply put, a geofence is a defining virtual boundary around geographic objects or an area, so that every time a user enters or leaves the boundary perimeters, actions or notifications can be triggered. With the increased use of smartphone, GPS, and location services, geofencing becomes an indispensable tool in location data analytics and intelligence. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:\n",

    "Geofencing applications are numerous, as we have seen in the introduction. They can be used in security, business, and smart home design, as well as a ton of other applications. However, the most widely used and common application for geofencing is marketing. In this section, we will cover the use of geofencing in marketing location-based services and products to illustrate and elaborate geofencing concepts with a real-world and concrete example. \n",

    "Advertising and marketing agencies have embraced geofencing to increase the effectiveness of their ads and reach their target users efficiently. Marketers deploy geofencing to send or display ads to users at the right time and in the right location once a user is within the perimeters of the geofence, entering it or leaving it. Although this is more likely to be in a mobile device, it also can be effectively used via desktops or tablets, triangulating from Wi-Fi locations. Let's visualize an example of two users"
