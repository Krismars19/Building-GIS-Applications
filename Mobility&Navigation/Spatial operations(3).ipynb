We will first choose points that fall within NYC district boundaries based on their locations using spatial join operations. A spatial join is when two geometry objects are merged based on their spatial relationship. In GeoPandas, we can carry out a spatial join with the .sjoin method, which takes two GeoDataFrames and an operation type. The operation type determines the type of join to apply. It could be an intersection, within, or contains operation, and can be carried out with different geometries, such as points with polygons, lines with polygons, or points with lines.\n","\n","To illustrate this, let's get points that are only within NYC districts.
